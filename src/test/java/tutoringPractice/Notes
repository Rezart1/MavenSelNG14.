each project will have three things:
1- group ID --usually is the domain name reversed (com.amazon), yoll.io->io.yoll
2- ArtifactID -- is the project name
3- version -- version can be 2 things; SNAPSHOT and simple version as 1.0.0 or 2.0.0
SNAPSHOT means it is under development
-pure version means it is deployed

Maven works this way:
when you installed maven on your computer it autmatically created a
hidden folder on our computer. and is called .m2
This folder/repository will contain all the tool used for maven projects
When you add a new tool to your pom.xml, what really happens:
-- maven will scan the m2 folder to see if there is already such tool
--if there is taht tool on you comp it will just use it
--ift the tool is not found it will go to internet (central maven repository) and downloaded
Always you need also tools and materials to build the house: first check on your shop (m2 folder in your computer)
and see if you have all needed tools(dependencies an jar files).
If not you go to home depot and buy some tools and materials (maven repository website).
You start building and then you need the inspection guy to check if everything is under the code.
If all set you're good to rent the apartments (deploy)
